#Here's the code for looping through the dictionary and printing all the keys and values:
# for each_key, each_value in customer_29876.items():
#  print("The customer's " + each_key + " is " + each_value)
#Following the instructions above, Python displays:
#The customer's first name is David
#The customer's last name is Elliott
#The customer's address is 4803 Wellesley St.
#This loop looks like the loops you've been coding, with two exceptions.
